# Design Decisions and Trade-Offs

## Next.js for SSR and Static Generation:
Decision: Chosen for its ability to render pages on the server or at build time, improving SEO and initial load times.
Trade-Off: Increased complexity compared to client-side rendering frameworks like CRA, but the benefits for SEO and performance outweigh this.

## Tailwind CSS for Styling:
Decision: Tailwind CSS was selected for its utility-first approach, enabling faster styling and consistent design.
Trade-Off: A learning curve for developers unfamiliar with utility classes, but this is mitigated by its comprehensive documentation and IntelliSense support.

## TypeScript for Static Typing:
Decision: Used to ensure type safety, reduce runtime errors, and improve developer productivity.
Trade-Off: Slightly longer development time due to type definitions, but it enhances code maintainability and reduces bugs.

## LocalStorage for Favourites:
Decision: Implemented for simplicity and ease of use without needing a backend.
Trade-Off: Limits persistence to the user's browser and may not sync across devices.

## Minimal Backend Integration:
Decision: Relied on public APIs to reduce backend complexity and focus on the frontend experience.
Trade-Off: Limited control over API data and possible rate limiting, but it simplifies the project setup and reduces infrastructure costs.
